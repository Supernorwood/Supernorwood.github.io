    <h2>= vs == vs Equal()</h2>

    <p><strong>= </strong>The basic assignment operator is equal ( = ), which
	assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y
	assigns the value of y to x .  </p>
    <p><strong>==</strong> Is a comparison operator in Java checks to see if
	the two objects being compared take up the same place in memory.</p>
    <p><strong>equals()	</strong> a method available in the String class that
	is used to compare two strings and determine whether they are equal.</p>

    <h2>Cast a Double to an Int</h2>
      <p>To ‘cast a double to an int,’ is taking an Object of one particular
	  type and “turning it into” another Object type. </p>
      <p>If I use a formula that will return a double and I would like to keep
	  them as doubles throughout the rest of my code. If at some point within
	  my code I would like to display a double as an integer.</p>

    <h2>import java.util.Scanner;</h2>
      <p>You are importing the scanner class in java to you current class.</p>
      <p><strong>Import</strong> is used whenever we want to use the features of other

    <h2>Parameters and Arguments</h2>
      <p><strong>Parameter</strong>is a variable in the declaration of a function.</p>
      <p><strong>Argument</strong>is the actual value of this variable that gets passed
	  to the function.</p>
	  <p>A <em>parameter</em> is something you have to fill in when you call a function.
	  What you put in it is the <em>argument.</em></p>

  <div class="main">
    <h2>Switch and If/Else Difference</h2>
      <p><strong>A Switch statement</strong>allows a variable to be tested for
	  equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the
	  variable being switched on is checked for each case.</p>
      <p><strong>An If statement can be followed by an Else </strong>which executes
	  when an expression is false.</p>
      <p>It is better to use switch-case instead of if-else when the numbers to
	  of cases to consider are many.If you want more complex conditions to be checked,
	  you want to use if-else.</p>
